Project Requirements
An entrepreneur wants to create a system where passengers can make reservations from different transportation companies.

Transportation companies provide services via railways, roadways, and airways. Some may serve in more than one mode (e.g., both airways and roadways).

The system should include an admin panel, a company panel, and a user panel.

Admin Panel
The admin panel should require a username and password for login. There should be only one admin in the system.

Admin panel functionalities:

View existing companies

Register a new company

Delete a company

Set a service fee (a fixed daily fee should be determined - 1000)

Company Panel
The company panel should require a username and password for login. Each company should have a username, password, and vehicle information.

Company panel functionalities:

Add and remove vehicles

Add and remove trips

Calculate daily profit. The daily profit should be calculated by considering passenger fees, service fees, personnel costs, and fuel costs.

User Panel
Users should be able to access the user panel directly without any membership system.

Users can access the "Search Ticket" button to find transportation options for a specific day.

User panel functionalities:

List transportation options for a specified day.

Make a reservation.

A user can make multiple reservations simultaneously from the same vehicle.

After purchasing a ticket, it should be clear that the reserved seats are no longer available for reservation.

Before starting the reservation process, the user should select the departure point, destination, and travel date.

The system should display only travel dates between December 4-10, 2023.

The user should also specify the number of passengers traveling.

After making selections, the "Find Trip" button should be clicked to query suitable trips.

The system should display available vehicles and their seat status on the selected date.

The user should select the trip they wish to take from among the options.

Available and reserved seat information for the selected trip should be displayed.

The user should select the empty seats according to the number of passengers traveling.

A separate information entry screen should appear for each passenger.

The user should enter information such as name, surname, ID number, and date of birth for each passenger.

After completing all passenger information entries, the "Make Payment" button should be clicked to complete the payment process.

Once the payment is successful, the selected trip and reserved seats should be displayed on the screen.

The reserved seats should be visible after the reservation is complete.


Companies and Routes
There are 3 different companies serving for roadways: A, B, and C.

Company D serves for railways.

Companies F and C serve for airways. Company C serves both roadways and airways.
